# üß™ Experiment 4 ‚Äì Aggregate & Built-in Functions

## üéØ Aim:

Implement SQL queries using aggregate functions (SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX, COUNT) and built-in functions (ASCII, ABS, CONCAT, SUBSTR, TRIM, UPPER, LOWER, COS, SIN, TAN, LOG, POWER, ROUND, FLOOR, CEIL, SQRT, and date functions) on a faculty table.

Faculty schema:

faculty(fid, name, dob, exp, no_of_awards, dno, sal, address, phone)

---

## üíª SQL Code

Paste the entire block below into MySQL Workbench:

```sql
-- Creating the faculty table
CREATE TABLE faculty (
  fid INT,
  name VARCHAR(50),
  dob DATE,
  exp INT,
  no_of_awards INT,
  dno INT,
  sal DECIMAL(10,2),
  address VARCHAR(100),
  phone VARCHAR(15)
);

-- 1. Sum of all salaries
SELECT SUM(sal) AS total_salary FROM faculty;

-- 2. Sum of salaries for dept no. 1
SELECT SUM(sal) AS dept1_total_salary FROM faculty WHERE dno = 1;

-- 3. Average, Min, Max salary
SELECT AVG(sal) AS avg_salary, MIN(sal) AS min_salary, MAX(sal) AS max_salary FROM faculty;

-- 4. Average, Min, Max salary for dept 4
SELECT AVG(sal) AS avg_salary_d4, MIN(sal) AS min_salary_d4, MAX(sal) AS max_salary_d4 
FROM faculty WHERE dno = 4;

-- 5. Average experience for dept 1
SELECT AVG(exp) AS avg_exp_d1 FROM faculty WHERE dno = 1;

-- 6. Count of faculties in college
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_faculty FROM faculty;

-- 7. Count of faculties in dept no. 2
SELECT COUNT(*) AS dept2_faculty_count FROM faculty WHERE dno = 2;

-- 8. Built-in function demonstration
SELECT 
  ASCII('A') AS ascii_val, 
  ABS(-5) AS abs_val, 
  CONCAT('Moin', 'AI') AS full_name, 
  SUBSTR('AI-DS', 1, 2) AS substr_result, 
  TRIM('   Hello   ') AS trimmed_text, 
  UPPER('hello') AS upper_text, 
  LOWER('HELLO') AS lower_text,
  COS(0) AS cos_val, 
  SIN(0) AS sin_val, 
  TAN(0) AS tan_val, 
  LOG(10) AS log_val, 
  POWER(2,3) AS power_val, 
  ROUND(3.145) AS rounded_val, 
  FLOOR(4.9) AS floor_val, 
  CEIL(4.1) AS ceil_val, 
  SQRT(16) AS sqrt_val;

-- 9. Date functions (demonstration using current date)
SELECT 
  CURDATE() AS today,
  NOW() AS current_time,
  DAY(CURDATE()) AS day_val,
  MONTH(CURDATE()) AS month_val,
  YEAR(CURDATE()) AS year_val;
```

## üé§ Viva Questions and Answers

1. ‚ùì What is the purpose of aggregate functions in SQL?  
   ‚úÖ Aggregate functions perform calculations on multiple rows of a table and return a single result, e.g., SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX, COUNT.

2. ‚ùì What does the SUM() function do?  
   ‚úÖ SUM() adds up all the numeric values in a specified column.

3. ‚ùì How is the AVG() function different from SUM()?  
   ‚úÖ AVG() returns the average (mean) value, while SUM() returns the total.

4. ‚ùì What is the purpose of COUNT()?  
   ‚úÖ COUNT() returns the number of rows that match a condition.

5. ‚ùì How do you find the highest salary in a table?  
   ‚úÖ By using SELECT MAX(sal) FROM faculty;

6. ‚ùì What is the use of the MIN() function?  
   ‚úÖ MIN() returns the smallest value from a column.

7. ‚ùì What is the output of COUNT(*) and COUNT(column_name)?  
   ‚úÖ COUNT(*) counts all rows; COUNT(column_name) counts non-null values in that column.

8. ‚ùì What does the ASCII() function do?  
   ‚úÖ It returns the ASCII code of the first character in a string.

9. ‚ùì What is the output of ASCII('A')?  
   ‚úÖ 65

10. ‚ùì What is the use of ABS() in SQL?  
    ‚úÖ ABS() returns the absolute (positive) value of a number.

11. ‚ùì How is CONCAT() used in SQL?  
    ‚úÖ CONCAT() joins two or more strings together. Example: CONCAT('Hello', 'World') ‚Üí HelloWorld

12. ‚ùì What does SUBSTR() or SUBSTRING() do?  
    ‚úÖ It extracts a part of a string starting from a specified position.

13. ‚ùì How does the TRIM() function help?  
    ‚úÖ TRIM() removes extra spaces from the beginning and end of a string.

14. ‚ùì What is the output of UPPER('hello')?  
    ‚úÖ HELLO

15. ‚ùì What is the use of LOWER() in SQL?  
    ‚úÖ It converts all characters in a string to lowercase.

16. ‚ùì What does COS(0), SIN(0), and TAN(0) return?  
    ‚úÖ COS(0) = 1, SIN(0) = 0, TAN(0) = 0

17. ‚ùì What does the LOG() function return in SQL?  
    ‚úÖ LOG() returns the natural logarithm (base e) of a number.

18. ‚ùì What is POWER(2,3) in SQL?  
    ‚úÖ It returns 8 (2 raised to the power of 3).

19. ‚ùì What is the difference between FLOOR() and CEIL()?  
    ‚úÖ FLOOR() rounds down to the nearest integer, CEIL() rounds up.

20. ‚ùì What does ROUND(3.145) return?  
    ‚úÖ It returns 3 (depending on default precision; can also round to specific decimals).

21. ‚ùì How do you calculate square root in SQL?  
    ‚úÖ Using SQRT(). Example: SQRT(16) returns 4.

22. ‚ùì What are date functions in SQL?  
    ‚úÖ Functions that extract or manipulate date values, e.g., CURDATE(), NOW(), YEAR(), MONTH(), DAY().

23. ‚ùì What is the difference between CURDATE() and NOW()?  
    ‚úÖ CURDATE() returns only the date, NOW() returns date and current time.

24. ‚ùì How do you extract the month from a date column?  
    ‚úÖ Using MONTH(date_column) function.

25. ‚ùì Can we use aggregate functions with WHERE clause?  
    ‚úÖ Yes, but only before aggregation. To filter after aggregation, use HAVING clause.
